Welcome to the DonorsChooseAutoScreening wiki!

Team Members: Justin Mao-Jones, Charles Guthrie, Yasumasa Miyamoto, Lucy Wang

In a nutshell, the aim of this project was to build a tool that could automatically screen new submissions to DonorsChoose.org.  Submissions are textual, consisting primarily of "essays" and itemized lists of requested resources (e.g. new books, calculators, ipads, etc). More specifically, this was a binary classification of essays and itemized lists associated with each submission.  We used NLP, [TF-IDF](https://github.com/justinmaojones/DonorsChooseAutoScreening/wiki/8.-TF-IDF-Interpretation), and other features to train the model.

The purpose of this wiki is to provide an overview of the modeling and analysis performed.  The material in this wiki goes beyond what is in a [final report](https://github.com/justinmaojones/DonorsChooseAutoScreening/blob/master/FinalReport_DonorsChooseAutoScreening.pdf) produced as part of a [class project](https://github.com/charlesdguthrie/frontrow/blob/master/final_report/fall14_ds_project_instructions.pdf).  Also, please feel free to browse our [code](https://github.com/justinmaojones/DonorsChooseAutoScreening).
